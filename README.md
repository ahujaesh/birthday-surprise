    - This is the default landing page for the website and serves as the introduction page
    - Uses Internal CSS and Javascript
    - It contains a tutorial written using [THREE.js](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three.js), HTML, CSS and Javascript
      - Within this tutorial, you complete three quests  to learn how to move around in the three.js world

- Other files
  - These files are used to help improve the content provided in the main files, or as github files
    - For example, [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ahujaesh/birthday-surprise/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), tells GitHub what contributing guidelines I have included
    - Another example is [favicon.png](https://github.com/ahujaesh/birthday-surprise/blob/main/favicon.png), as it adds the favicon to both .html pages
  - Please ignore the files in .idea, my main editor, Android Studio for Windows, added them and I don't really know why.
