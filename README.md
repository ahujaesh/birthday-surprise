An overview of this repository:

This repository contains 2 main .html files, that both use Internal CSS and Javascript for easy readability. It also contains some other files. I have outlined the purpose of each of these files below, along with a higherarchy of importance. If you have something to add, feel free to shoot me a PR or an Issue.

- File one ([index.html](https://github.com/ahujaesh/birthday-surprise/blob/main/index.html)):
    - This is the default landing page for the website and serves as the introduction page
    - Uses Internal CSS and Javascript
    - It contains a tutorial written using [THREE.js](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three.js), HTML, CSS and Javascript
      - Within this tutorial, you complete three quests  to learn how to move around in the three.js world
    - Upon competition, it leads you to the next page for the main quest
    - You can view this file [here](https://ahujaesh.github.io/birthday-surprise/)

- File two ([pt2.html](https://github.com/ahujaesh/birthday-surprise/blob/main/pt2.html))
  - This is the Main Quest and is only accessible by going to the link directly, or by completing the tutorial ([index.html](https://github.com/ahujaesh/birthday-surprise/blob/main/index.html))
  - Uses Internal CSS and Javascript
  - Within this main quest, your goal is to find all seven dragon eggs that are scattered around this world.
    - This is also written using [THREE.js](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three.js), and uses the same movement system as index.html
    - See the [todo list](https://github.com/ahujaesh/birthday-surprise/issues/17) to see all the improvements that are in progress
    - This needs to be done before **February 27, 2024** 
  - Upon completion, it says "Happy Birthday", and ends the game
  - You can view this file [here](https://ahujaesh.github.io/birthday-surprise/pt2.html)
  - I could use a lot of help completing this before **February 27, 2024**, so if you see something you think you can help with, I would be very grateful!

    - For example, [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ahujaesh/birthday-surprise/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), tells GitHub what contributing guidelines I have included
    - Another example is [favicon.png](https://github.com/ahujaesh/birthday-surprise/blob/main/favicon.png), as it adds the favicon to both .html pages
